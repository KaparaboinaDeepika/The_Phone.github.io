        <h style="font-size: 20px;">Communication plays a major role in conveying information from one person to the other. Earlier, in the ancient days, there was no medium to communicate between people living apart. People used to talk directly only through conversation. Later, writing letters became the only medium to send a message, from country to country. Pigeon post was used to send highly secured information. This telegram continued till Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876 which turned out to be a new era. But the only disadvantage is that there was no mobility for the telephone which is wire connected. Then later the cell phone was invented by Martin Cooper which moved the world to wireless communication times. Now, there are mobiles which were updated with Bluetooth, wifi, internet connections, which made us explore more about the world. The latest updates can be quickly shared and can even go viral within a single second. I always wonder about how the world changed in means of communication from telephone, landlines to Android and IOS. Now we have different platforms to communicate with people. Other than phone calls and messaging, now we are also able to make video conferences, promoting products marketing is being done in a very simple and easy manner by sharing the posters by promoting through different social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, etc. In this way, we can say that communication through different media has brought a lot of change in our daily lives. Apart from all the advantages we have, shopping, payments are also done through mobiles which became a milestone change. But, considering the cons of using mobile, nowadays people are being cheated and there's no security for our information. Children are getting addicted to mobiles which can cause eye & ear problems etc. People forget to communicate with close ones/ family and get addicted to communicating on mobiles with strangers. So, communication is important in our daily life but we need to take care of our privacy terms and be secure. It's better if we don't get trapped by fraudulent calls and messages. Using mobile healthily and securely can make us live a better way of life.

Over the past few years, phones were sold at a low price to the common people and now they are popular for communication. Instant communication is made possible through phones. We are so dependent on phones that it became difficult to imagine a life without phones.


The phone is helping in transforming our society into an open society. It is quite beneficial for differently-abled people and senior citizens to live an independent life.

In emergencies, mobile phones act as life-saving units. Due to the delay in informing without phones, many lives would have been lost.
People who lived before the ancient era may be able to cope up with a life without phones because they are already adapted to it, but the generation which was born after the invention of phones has become a common thing can find it difficult to live without phones.
Many people are preferring virtual lives due to phones to maintaining real connections. With this, so many people are feeling alone. This is causing social anxiety issues too. Without phones, there would have been many more face-to-face conversations.
The invention of smartphones increased many distractions in our minds. Without phones, our focus on our work will improve a lot.
Continuous use of the phone's entire 24/7 availability is causing anxiety issues for many. In those days people used to ask whether they can meet, but now people are expecting 24/7 availability on phones from everyone.
